# HCI-Defense-P3
This is our first website that we created for our HCI Defense in P3. 
> Introduction <
Hello CdeO is a travel-themed project that aims to present 12 of the most frequented tourist attractions in Cagayan de Oro City. Each tourist attraction is in its own separate HTML file to enable more structuring of content and a neater user interface. The pages contain in-depth descriptions, image sliders, and integrated Google Maps to enable the users to easily visualize and locate the tourist attractions. To ensure responsiveness and clean design, the project uses HTML and CSS alongside the Bootstrap framework. Each page features a consistent layout, with a styled container, vivid imagery using Bootstrap’s carousel, and a readable font. The visual design creates an inviting user experience that adapts well across different devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.What is special about this project is the addition of location-based elements. Every page of a tourist destination has an interactive Google Maps embed so that the users can easily get directions or view the location. Not only does this help the users plan their trip more effectively, but it also makes every webpage look modern and informative. Overall, Hello CdeO is not just a school project—it's a nicely crafted web project that demonstrates competence in modular front-end development, responsive design, and practical usability. It aims to promote local tourism in Cagayan de Oro and be a good stepping stone for the developer's web development career.
